# Windows 11 Clone
Windows 11 clone using `HTML`, `CSS`, and `Javascript`. Feel free to use any of the code anywhere you want.

This was originally motivated by one of our favorite YouTubers, `CodeWithHarry`. He made a video on this clone but he used screenshots. At the end of the video, he asked to take it to next level and do it using only `CSS`. So, that's what I did.

Although I am not on the path to be Web Developer, but I love creating beatuful UIs.

You are free to use the code in this project anywhere you like. I do own it but it's code and we are programmers. Code doesn't really belong to just one of us :D. Seriously though, use the code as you wish. Just give some sort of credit in the corner. I'll do appreciate that. xD
